# Ride-Sharing-Application
This Application facilitates ride-sharing by giving users a choice to either offer or find rides.
In simple terms, carpooling/ride-sharing refers to sharing empty seats in a vehicle. People commuting from one point to another can share empty seats with other passengers who are travelling on the same route.

When the application is launched, the user gets to make an account and pick to either offer a ride or take a ride.

A ride taker gets to share empty seats in ride giverâ€™s vehicle and has a comfortable commute.
If he wants to take a ride, he can enter his PickUp Address and Drop Address, once the Identity Proof is Verified, a list of Available Ride Givers will be sent, once selected, the Ride Giver's Details will be sent.

A ride giver reduces his/her commuting costs by sharing fuel expenses with other passengers.
If he wants to offer a ride, he can enter the StartAddress and EndAddress, once the Driving license is verified, he will get a list of Ride Takers to confirm, once confirmed, the Ride Taker's Details will be sent.
Once the user creates an account, he can view his
